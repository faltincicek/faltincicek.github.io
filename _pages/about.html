I'm currently a PhD candidate in experimental condensed matter physics at the University of Alberta expecting to graduate in 2025 May. My research interest is in nanotechnology, specifically in atomic scale electronics. I study hydrogen passivated silicon surface with a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope, which allows removal of individual hydrogen atoms hence patterning one atom at a time. You will find more information about this throughout my webpage. Besides my current research about atomic electronics, I have interest in quantum computers, data anaylsis, statistical analysis and machine learning.

For now I would like to use this webpage as my interactive resume. Below links will take you to relevant pages.

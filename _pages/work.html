  <li>
    2019 - present, Graduate Researcher at the Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Canada
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Operated and maintained ultra-high vacuum, low-temperature (~4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV LT-STM).</li>
      <li>Fixed malfunctioning parts such as rough pump, UHV direct-current sample heater and practiced ventilation and baking of the UHV system.</li>
      <li>Managed lab's cryogenics (liquid nitrogen and helium) consumption and maintained helium recovery plant.</li>
      <li>Lead a project about making atomic wires on the silicon surface with LT-STM.</li>
      <li>Explained quantum mechanical and molecular background of wires in collaborated with theorists.</li>
      <li>Made atomic switches that function as a one-electron process with applications to atomic memory elements and random number generation.</li>
      <li>Learned density functional theory (DFT) and applied to what I would be normally doing in the lab during the Covid pandemic lock-down.</li>
    </ul>

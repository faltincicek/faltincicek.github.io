<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>
    2019 - present, Graduate Researcher at the Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Canada
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Operated and maintained ultra-high vacuum, low-temperature (~4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV LT-STM).</li>
      <li>Repaired malfunctioning parts such as rough pump, UHV direct-current sample heater and practiced ventilation and baking of the UHV system. Replaced faulty turbo pump, bad capacitors of power supplies etc.</li>
      <li>Took part in upgrading the LT-STM to QPlus non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM).</li>
      <li>Managed lab's cryogenics (liquid nitrogen and helium) consumption and maintained helium recovery plant.</li>
      <li>Made single atom sharp STM tips (needles) with electrochemical etching and field ion microscope (FIM).</li>
      <li>Developed LabView programs to ease my job in the lab such as pressure reader, camera view of STM from two sides, and cryostat's level and temperature reader.</li>
      <li>Passivated silicon surface with monolayer hydrogen and made atomic patterns one atom at a time.</li>
      <li>Lead a project about making atomic wires on the silicon surface with LT-STM and conducted molecular orbital analysis through scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).</li>
      <li>Explained the agreement of molecular analysis of my measurements with theory in collaboration with theorists.</li>
      <li>Devloped a numerical simulation of the atomic wires I made and coded it in Python.</li>
      <li>Analyzed atomic wires data with Fourier transform to study their electronic bands and effective masses.</li>
      <li>Made atomic switches that function as a one-electron process with applications to atomic memory elements and random number generation.</li>
      <li>Analyzed the atomic switcher's transition rates statistically to determine their randomness level.</li>
      <li>Characterized surface quality of nanolithographed samples prepared in the clean room with photolithography and e-beam lithography with STM.</li>
      <li>Learned density functional theory (DFT) and applied to what I would be normally doing in the lab during the Covid pandemic lock-down.</li>
      <li>Worked with Slurm Workload Manager (sbatch) on supercomputers of Digital Research Alliance of Canada (previously ComputeCanada) to perform DFT calculations.</li>
      <li>Attended several international conferences to present my research.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    2017 - 2019, Graduate Researcher at the Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of North Dakota, USA
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Assembled a home-built chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system with spare rough and turbo pump, argon gas cylinder, and tube furnace for quartz tubes.</li>
      <li>Synthesized quasi-two-dimensional chromium sulfides with the CVD system I built.</li>
      <li>Characterized two dimensional molecules I deposited on mica with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).</li>
      <li>Collaborated with groups from the Petroleum Engineering and Chemistry departments in two separate projects where I analyzed their samples with XPS, which yielded two papers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    2014 - 2017, Undergraduate Researcher at the Department of Physics, Bilkent University, Turkey
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Studied the Gross-Pitaevski-Poisson (GPP) system to model compact astrophysical objects as Bose-Einstein Condensates (BCE) with computational methods.</li>
      <li>Numerically simulated a solvable model of Maxwell's Demon and conducted statisctical analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    2015 Summer, Summer Intern at the Department of Physics, Middle East Technical University, Turkey
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Studied NASA's data on neutron stars and pulsars with FTOOLS software on linux OS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Abstract:
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are atomically thin semiconductors of the type MX2 with M being a transition metal and X being a chalcogen atom. TMDs have recently attracted considerable attention because of their novel electronic and optical properties. Many TMDs have been studied except CrS2 because of the challenges in its synthesis. However, the most stable form of chromium sulfides, Cr2S3, chromium (III) sulfide, has been known to exhibit novel properties. For this reason, we studied the possibility of synthesizing thin Cr2S3 to mimic CrS2. We synthesized single phase Cr2S3 in vacuum sealed quartz tubes. The synthesis takes about 5 days. After the synthesis, we deposited Cr2S3 on sapphire substrates via solid-vapor growth method. For characterization, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) techniques were used and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used for imaging the quasi-two-dimensional Cr2S3 particles.

**Abstract:**

Bare silicon dimers on hydrogen-terminated Si(100) have two dangling bonds. These are atomically localized regions of high state density near to and within the bulk silicon band gap. We studied bare silicon dimers as monomeric units. Silicon dimer wires are much more stable than wires composed of individual dangling bonds. Dimer wires composed of 1 to 5 dimers were intentionally fabricated and characterised by STM techniques combined with density functional theory to provide detailed insights into geometric and electronic structure. Structural and dynamic qualities displayed by short wires were shown to be similar to the characteristics of a relatively long 37 dimer wire. Rather than adding two states into the band gap, experiment and theory reveal that each dimer adds one empty state into the gap and one filled state into the valence bands. Coupling among these states provides a conduction pathway with small bulk coupling.
